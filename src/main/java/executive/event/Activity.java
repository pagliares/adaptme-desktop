// Small class file to enable entity execution without pointers

/**
 * A way of implementing activity execution without method pointers. Needed
 * because, when scheduling an entity to some future B or when causing that
 * entity to do this B, the B needs to be passed as a parameter. The Bs
 * themselves are really methods but, by implementing this interface, can be
 * treated as classes that can be instantiated.
